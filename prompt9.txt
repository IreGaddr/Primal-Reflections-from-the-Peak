Read the "Physical Predictions" section (sections 5â€“7) of iothilbertspace.txt again.

Questions:
1. Compute the expected frequency shift for a cavity with R = 15 cm, r = 0.5 cm.  Does the 1/360 rule still hold?
2. Which of the listed near-term tests is most feasible at undergraduate-lab scale?
3. Suggest one brand-new experiment (not mentioned) that could falsify the r/R = 1/30 claim.

Prepare a one-paragraph proposal for that new experiment.
