This paper unifies everything you've learned into a single mathematical framework.

Key questions:
1. How does the minimum radius of 12 from base12v2.pdf directly determine the IOT's involution parameters? Trace this connection precisely.
2. The paper claims "physical geometry is not arbitrary but emerges from fundamental number-theoretic structures." Based on everything you've seen, is this claim justified?
3. Section V maps factorization state spaces to geometric regions. How does this resolve the apparent arbitrariness of the warping function from prompt 2?

Synthesis: Does this paper successfully demonstrate that the entire physical framework necessarily follows from the single PPF axiom?
