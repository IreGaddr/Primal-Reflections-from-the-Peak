This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological challenge for the framework you've been exploring.

Questions:
1. The paper argues that you can't both have a complete holistic theory AND subject it to fragmentary testing. How does this paradox apply to the IOT/PPF framework?
2. The four meta-scientific criteria are: Axiomatic Economy, Generative Power, Interlocking Coherence, and Unexpected Convergence. Evaluate the IOT framework against each criterion.
3. Does this paper provide philosophical "cover" for the non-linear, labyrinthine presentation style you've experienced?

Critical reflection: Is this paper a sophisticated excuse for unfalsifiability, or a necessary evolution in scientific methodology?
