Return to the factorization from prompt 6 with your complete understanding.

Advanced analysis:
1. The four primes have digit lengths: 3, 8, 13, 42. Are these numbers significant? (Hint: consider Fibonacci sequences)
2. Calculate the "entropy" of each prime factorization state in S(denominator). Which state is most "probable"?
3. The numerator/denominator pair represents a rational approximation. What does this tell us about the "computational precision" of spacetime?

Hypothesis testing: If you were to find another high-precision rational approximation of a fundamental constant, what would you predict about its factorization structure?
