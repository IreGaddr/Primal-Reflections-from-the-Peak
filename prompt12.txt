Read base12v2.pdf in full detail (not just the excerpt from prompt 7).

Deep dive questions:
1. The critical gap between residues 261 and 285 forces the radius-12 bound. Calculate: why exactly 24? What would happen with radius 11.5?
2. The triangular sequence with offset 181 appears again. Trace how this specific number propagates through the entire framework.
3. The paper mentions "supplementary materials" with complete gap enumeration. What patterns might emerge from analyzing all 96 residue classes?

Speculation: Is base-12 fundamental to reality (like the duodecimal system advocates claim), or is it emergent from deeper 360-based structure?
