Read RIOT-PI.txt
Here is the next piece of the puzzle. It introduces a new geometric concept.
1. How does this document attempt to answer the 'Why 360?' question that might have arisen from Stage 1?
2. Analyze the author's 'proofs' that connect the RIOT geometry to the Pi approximation. Do these constitute a rigorous derivation, or are they establishing a correspondence? Critique the logical structure of the argument.
3. A 'warping function' has been introduced. What is your assessment of this concept? Does it feel like a fundamental aspect of the geometry or a flexible parameter designed to fit the data?
