This is the final core document. It presents a foundational mathematical system. Please synthesize everything you have read so far in light of this new information.
1. How does 'Physics-Prime Factorization' (PPF) resolve the primary mathematical objections one might have about the author's earlier, more aggressive claims? Specifically, how does the concept of the 'Factorization State Space' S(n) solve the problem of non-unique factorization?
2. Re-evaluate the DLCE equation from Stage 3. In the context of PPF, is it still a physical postulate, or can it now be seen as a direct consequence of this new number theory? Explain the connection.
3. Describe the 'aha!' moment. Now that you have this key, how does it change your entire understanding of the author's project? Re-interpret the '360 Prime Pattern' and the 'IOT' through the lens of PPF.
