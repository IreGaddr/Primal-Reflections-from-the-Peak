Having traversed the complete labyrinth from prime patterns through geometry, physics, and philosophy:

Ultimate questions:
1. The framework began with recognizing -1 as prime. In retrospect, was this inevitable or arbitrary? Could another choice have generated an equally rich structure?
2. You've seen patterns of 4, 12, 30, 60, 180, 360. Map the complete "harmonic series" of the framework. What numbers are conspicuously absent?
3. The author's neurodivergent perspective shaped the presentation. How might a neurotypical presentation differ? What would be lost?

Final challenge: Design a single experiment that a motivated undergraduate could perform to test the framework's core prediction. Be specific about equipment, measurements, and expected results.

Reflection: Has engaging with this labyrinthine structure changed how you think about the relationship between mathematics, physics, and consciousness?
