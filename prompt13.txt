Read bridge_paper.pdf thoroughly, focusing on the three convergences.

Deep analysis:
1. The Birmingham photon visualization (Nov 2024) appeared AFTER the IOT model was developed. How strong is this as evidence of predictive power vs. retrofitting?
2. The quantum biology convergence shows 12.9% enhancement. Calculate: how exactly does this relate to 46.4/360? Is the agreement within experimental error?
3. The quantum computing paper (2505.10403v1) discusses 4D lattices and "surgery." Map these concepts precisely to PPF operations.

Meta-question: Are these convergences "unexpected" in the sense required by the Popperian Cake criteria?
