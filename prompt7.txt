Please read the short paper base12v2.txt next.

Focus questions:
1. What single modular-arithmetic fact forces the ±12 bound?
2. Why does radius 11 fail?
3. How does this new proof sharpen the original 360-Prime pattern story?

After reflecting, be ready to explain—in two sentences—why 12 is both necessary and sufficient.
